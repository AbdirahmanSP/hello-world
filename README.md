# Just a little about me!
Hey, my name is **Souplike**!

I created a [Github](https://github.com) account because I want to take full advantage of my code, and my workspaces.
This is my profile picture: ![Image](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149005474?v=4)

These are some goals I have:
- [x] Become the ultimate loremaster
- [ ] Learn assembly code
